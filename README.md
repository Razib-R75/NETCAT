# Netcat (ncat) Project Overview

## Introduction
This repository documents my project with Netcat (ncat), a versatile networking tool used for reading, writing, forwarding, and redirecting data across network connections. This project demonstrates various uses of Netcat for network communication, file creation, and basic network testing.

## Netcat Commands Used
The following Netcat commands were used in this project:

1. **Listening for Connections**
   ```
   ncat -lvp <port number>
   ```
   This command sets up a Netcat listener on a specified port to accept incoming connections.

2. **Testing Connection to a Host**
   ```
   nc -nvz <ip> <port>
   ```
   This is used to test the connection to a specific IP and port, verifying if the port is open.

3. **Secure Listening with SSL**
   ```
   ncat -lvp <port number> --ssl
   ```
   This variation of the listening command adds SSL encryption for secure communication.

4. **Secure Connection Test with SSL**
   ```
   nc -nvz <ip> <port> --ssl
   ```
   Similar to the basic connection test but with SSL encryption for enhanced security.

5. **Remote Command Execution**
   ```
   nc -lvp <port number> -e cmd.exe
   ```
   Opens a listener that executes `cmd.exe` upon establishing a connection, allowing remote command execution (use with caution).

6. **Directory Listing**
   ```
   dir
   ```
   Lists the contents of the current directory.

7. **Creating a Text File**
   ```
   echo Hello > hello.txt
   ```
   Creates a file named `hello.txt` and writes "Hello" into it.

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate basic network communication using Netcat.
- Showcase secure data transmission with SSL.
- Understand the implications of remote command execution.
- Create and manipulate files using command-line operations.

## Disclaimer
- All commands were used in a controlled lab environment.
- Remote command execution was conducted with full authorization and under strict safety protocols.
- This project is for educational purposes, and the commands should not be used maliciously or without proper authorization.

## Usage and Testing
- The commands can be replicated in a controlled environment for learning and testing network communication.
- Ensure proper security measures are in place when experimenting with remote command execution.
